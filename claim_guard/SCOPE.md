# Scope Statement

This repository implements **verifiable components** (ledger, digital soul, evidence scenes, causal sims) and
a disciplined attestation pipeline. It **does not** claim that simulation outputs are legally admissible evidence
or that any unsolved mathematical conjecture has been resolved without peerâ€‘reviewed proof.

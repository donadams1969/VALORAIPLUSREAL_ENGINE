python tools/ed25519_sign.py keygen --out keys
python tools/sign_manifest.py --keys keys --manifest artifacts/MANIFEST_SHA256.txt --out artifacts
python tools/build_artifact_card.py --out artifacts
```

---

## 🔐 Attestation & Verification

* `tools/build_manifest.py` → `artifacts/MANIFEST_SHA256.txt` + `manifest.json`
* `tools/ed25519_sign.py` / `tools/sign_manifest.py` → signature file (`.sig`)
* `tools/build_artifact_card.py` → `artifacts/artifact_card.json` (hashes + sizes)

**Modular Verification (for third parties)**

To verify the integrity of the signed artifacts, use the `tools/verify_signature.py` script. You will need three files: the public key, the manifest, and the signature file.

```bash
# Ensure the required library is installed
pip install ed25519

# Run the verification
python tools/verify_signature.py \
  --key keys/signing.pub \
  --file artifacts/MANIFEST_SHA256.txt \
  --signature artifacts/MANIFEST_SHA256.txt.sig
```

This provides a concrete, repeatable method for anyone to verify the integrity of your work.

## 🛡 Claim Guard & Scope

This repo enforces a **claim guard** in CI and **requires** a scope statement.

> We provide **verifiable components** (immutable ledger, Digital Soul™, evidentiary scenes, causal sims) and a disciplined **attestation pipeline** (manifests, signatures, claim guard). We do **not** claim a solution to the Clay Millennium Problem or legal admissibility without independent, peer-reviewed validation and jurisdiction-specific requirements.

If someone commits prohibited phrases (e.g., “we solved global regularity,” “peer review is unnecessary”), **CI fails**.

---

## ⚠️ Important Limitations (Scope Statement)

This is a foundational toolkit. It provides **verifiable components** for building high-integrity simulations.

However, by itself, this alpha kit **does not** produce legally admissible evidence or solve complex scientific problems (like global regularity for the Navier–Stokes equations). Achieving such results requires extensive, independent, peer-reviewed validation and adherence to domain-specific legal and scientific standards. Use this kit as a rigorous starting point for building those capabilities honestly.

---

## 🗺️ Roadmap (Q4 2025)

* 🔗 **Ledger**: Ethereum/Optimism RPC adapter + receipts.
* ⛓️ **Chronos-Anchor**: true Bitcoin OTS proofs (replace local stub).
* 🛰️ **Renderer API**: REST/GraphQL stream for 3D clients.
* 🧮 **Numerics**: rational-certificate interval proofs for causal sims.
* 🧾 **CI**: `latexmk` to auto-build PDFs and attach to Releases.

---

## 📖 Deep-Dive: **Verifiable Simulation & Consequence Engine (Alpha)**

This is a **starter kit for trustworthy, auditable simulations**—ideal for “digital crime scenes,” historical reconstructions, and institutional-failure analyses where **provability** matters as much as visuals.

**Core principles**

* **Verifiability:** every datum/action independently checkable.
* **Immutability:** history cannot be secretly altered.
* **Honesty:** built-in checks prevent unsupported claims.

### 1) Immutable Action Ledger (**Sovereign Lock**)

Creates a **permanent audit trail** of decisions. Each action is **SHA-256 hashed**, **Ed25519 signed**, and logged. Includes a **Solidity stub** for future on-chain anchoring.
*Why?* Like a notary’s logbook for your sim—tamper evidence and provenance.

### 2) Complex Agent Modeling (**Digital Soul**)

Psychologically rich agents with **traits + trauma/resilience/moral-injury indices** that evolve with events.
*Why?* Authentic human/institution dynamics, not finite-state puppets.

### 3) Verifiable Evidence Timeline (**Digital Witness Scene**)

Securely ingests evidence into a **scene graph**, timestamped with an **OTS-style Chronos-Anchor**.
*Why?* Prove “this existed at time T” and reconstruct narratives with integrity.

### 4) Causal “What-If” (**Quantum Causal Inference**)

Run **SCM-based do-interventions** and narrate long-horizon consequences.
*Why?* Model systemic effects, not one-frame physics.

### 5) Automated Integrity (**Attestation & CI Guards**)

Automatic **manifests + signatures**; CI **Claim Guard** rejects overclaims.
*Why?* Transparency you can hand to auditors and courts.

**Quick Tour**

```bash
python cli/commit_action.py --actor "UnitTest" --kind DECISION --details "Approved policy X"
python digital_soul/generate_agent.py --name "PatientZero"
python digital_soul/update_agent.py --name "PatientZero" --event "Institutional Betrayal"
python veracity/ingest_evidence.py --src samples/evidence_sample.json
python causal/simulate_causal.py --graph samples/causal_graph.json --do "PolicyBlock=1" --steps 24
python tools/build_manifest.py --root . --out artifacts
python tools/ed25519_sign.py keygen --out keys
python tools/sign_manifest.py --keys keys --manifest artifacts/MANIFEST_SHA256.txt --out artifacts
python tools/build_artifact_card.py --out artifacts
```

**Scope statement (limitations)**
This alpha provides **verifiable components**. It **does not** by itself produce legally admissible evidence or solve open scientific problems (e.g., 3D NSE global regularity). Those outcomes require **independent, peer-reviewed validation** and domain-specific legal standards.

## 🌍 Societal Implications

The VALOR AI+® — GENESIS ENGINE project, as an open-source simulation toolkit emphasizing hyper-veracity, immutable actions, and long-term causal modeling, carries a range of potential societal implications if it gains adoption or evolves beyond its current alpha stage. Given its niche focus on "honest" simulations for high-integrity scenarios—like reconstructing crime scenes, analyzing historical events, or modeling institutional failures—these implications span ethics, technology access, decision-making, and broader cultural shifts. I'll break them down into key areas, based on the project's stated goals and features as of September 2025.

### ✨ Positive Implications
- **Enhanced Transparency and Accountability in Complex Systems**: By incorporating cryptographic anchoring (e.g., Sovereign Lock™ and Chronos-Anchor™), the engine could promote verifiable simulations that resist tampering. This might benefit fields like investigative journalism, legal proceedings, or policy analysis, where reconstructing events with "immutable consequences" could lead to more evidence-based decisions. For instance, simulating long-term policy outcomes (via Quantum Causal Inference) could help governments or NGOs anticipate societal impacts, potentially reducing errors in areas like climate modeling or economic forecasting.

- **Advancements in Education and Historical Understanding**: Tools for creating psychologically realistic AI agents (Digital Soul™ Core) and evidence-based scenes could democratize access to interactive historical recreations or ethical dilemma simulations. This might foster deeper public empathy and critical thinking, especially if integrated with educational platforms, encouraging a society more attuned to cause-and-effect in human behavior and systems.

- **Ethical AI Development Norms**: The built-in "claim guard" mechanism, which prevents unsubstantiated hype in code commits, sets a precedent for responsible open-source AI projects. If widely adopted, it could inspire similar safeguards across the tech ecosystem, reducing misinformation about AI capabilities and promoting a culture of humility and verification in software development.

- **Innovation in High-Stakes Simulations**: With planned Q4 2025 features like blockchain integration (e.g., Ethereum adapters and Bitcoin timestamp proofs), it could enable decentralized, tamper-proof collaborative simulations. This might accelerate progress in scientific research, such as modeling biological or social systems, leading to breakthroughs that benefit public health or urban planning.

### ⚠️ Negative or Challenging Implications
- **Risks of Misuse and Misinformation**: Despite veracity claims, flawed inputs or biased models could produce "immutable" but inaccurate simulations, entrenching false narratives. In a society increasingly reliant on AI, this might exacerbate echo chambers or be weaponized for propaganda, especially if used in sensitive areas like election analysis or conflict reconstructions without rigorous oversight.

- **Privacy and Ethical Concerns with AI Agents**: The Digital Soul™ feature, which generates evolving agents based on psychological traits and events, raises questions about simulating human-like entities. If applied to real-world data (e.g., personal histories), it could infringe on privacy rights or enable surveillance-like tools, potentially normalizing digital profiling in employment, insurance, or social credit systems.

- **Widening Digital Divides**: As a Python-based toolkit requiring specific bundles, setups, and technical know-how, it's not user-friendly for non-experts. This could limit its benefits to tech-savvy elites or institutions, reinforcing inequalities in access to advanced simulation tools. In a broader societal context, if such technologies become standard for decision-making (e.g., in courts or policymaking), those without resources to engage might be marginalized.

- **Over-Reliance on Simulations for Real-World Decisions**: Emphasizing "physics of consequence" might encourage a false sense of certainty in probabilistic models, leading to poor societal choices if simulations overlook uncertainties. For example, long-horizon causal inferences could influence public policy on issues like AI regulation or environmental strategies, but errors in assumptions (e.g., ignoring chaotic variables) might cause unintended harm.

- **Resource and Environmental Footprint**: Advanced features like blockchain integration could increase computational demands, contributing to energy consumption in an era of climate concerns. If scaled, this might conflict with societal pushes for sustainable tech, highlighting tensions between innovation and ecological responsibility.

### 🔭 Overall Societal Outlook
In its current form—still alpha with no releases, minimal community activity, and no evident public traction as of September 2025—the project's immediate societal impact is negligible. It's essentially a conceptual prototype, likely driven by a single developer, with ambitious but unproven claims. However, if it achieves its roadmap milestones (e.g., API renderers for 3D clients or rational-certificate proofs), it could contribute to a paradigm where simulations are treated as "digital witnesses" in everyday discourse, shifting society toward more data-driven, consequence-aware thinking. Conversely, without broader adoption or ethical guidelines, it risks becoming another overhyped AI tool that amplifies existing divides.

To mitigate negatives, integration with standards like open data protocols or third-party audits would be key. If you're exploring this for a specific use case, consider how its verifiability features align with societal needs—let me know for deeper dives!
